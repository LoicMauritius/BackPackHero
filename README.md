# BackPackHero
Projet de BUT1_BackPackHero_remake

Project: BackPackHero/src/fr/but/Mauritius_Loic_Booms_Amaury/Main.java

This project is a remake of the video game BackPackHero made for my first year of my cursus "BUT informatique".
For this project, I use a the Eclipse IDE and a graphic library called zen5 (zen5.jar).
This game was created in MVC model ( Model – View – Controller ).

It's a game created in Java were you have a hero and your goal is to go though the 10 floors of the dungeon.
The treasures gives you a sword to ficht the ennemies and the ennemies only have two options ( protect and attack ).
This game is not finish because of a lack of time.
The hero cannot heal himself so it's impossible to reach the end of the dungeon.

This project was just a training project to make us improve our comprehension of oriented object programmation using Java language.
